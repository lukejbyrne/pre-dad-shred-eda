To calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between the calories consumed and weight loss across 12 intervals where calories in are maintained at 2200 kcal and weight loss decreases by 1 each week, we need to establish the values for both variables.

Let's denote:
- Calories Consumed (Calories In): 2200 kcal (constant value)
- Weight Loss: 180, 179, 178, ..., 169 (decreases by 1 each week for 12 intervals)

Here are the values for the variables:

Calories In: \( 2200, 2200, 2200, \ldots, 2200 \) (12 times)

Weight Loss: \( 180, 179, 178, \ldots, 169 \) (12 times)

The Pearson correlation coefficient (r) formula is:

\[ r = \frac{\sum{(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}}{\sqrt{\sum{(x_i - \bar{x})^2} \sum{(y_i - \bar{y})^2}}} \]

Where:
- \( x_i \) is each value of the Calories In.
- \( \bar{x} \) is the mean of the Calories In.
- \( y_i \) is each value of the Weight Loss.
- \( \bar{y} \) is the mean of the Weight Loss.

To compute \( \bar{x} \) and \( \bar{y} \), we sum up all the values and divide by the number of values.

Let's calculate:

\[ \bar{x} = \frac{2200 + 2200 + \ldots + 2200}{12} = 2200 \]

\[ \bar{y} = \frac{180 + 179 + \ldots + 169}{12} \]

Now, let's calculate the numerator and the denominator of the Pearson correlation coefficient formula:

\[ \text{Numerator} = \sum{(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})} \]
\[ \text{Denominator} = \sqrt{\sum{(x_i - \bar{x})^2} \sum{(y_i - \bar{y})^2}} \]

After computing the numerator and denominator, we can find \( r \) by dividing the numerator by the denominator.

Let's proceed with the calculations to find the Pearson correlation coefficient \( r \).

First, let's compute \( \bar{y} \), the mean of the weight loss values:

\[ \bar{y} = \frac{180 + 179 + 178 + \ldots + 169}{12} = \frac{12(180 + 169)}{2 \times 12} = \frac{12 \times 349}{24} = \frac{4188}{24} = 174.5 \]

Now, let's calculate the numerator and the denominator of the Pearson correlation coefficient formula:

Numerator:
\[ \text{Numerator} = \sum{(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})} \]
\[ = (2200 - 2200)(180 - 174.5) + (2200 - 2200)(179 - 174.5) + \ldots + (2200 - 2200)(169 - 174.5) \]
\[ = 0 \times 5.5 + 0 \times 4.5 + \ldots + 0 \times (-5.5) \]
\[ = 0 \]

Denominator:
\[ \text{Denominator} = \sqrt{\sum{(x_i - \bar{x})^2} \sum{(y_i - \bar{y})^2}} \]
\[ = \sqrt{(2200 - 2200)^2 + (2200 - 2200)^2 + \ldots + (2200 - 2200)^2} \times \sqrt{(180 - 174.5)^2 + (179 - 174.5)^2 + \ldots + (169 - 174.5)^2} \]
\[ = \sqrt{0^2 + 0^2 + \ldots + 0^2} \times \sqrt{5.5^2 + 4.5^2 + \ldots + (-5.5)^2} \]
\[ = 0 \times \sqrt{5.5^2 + 4.5^2 + \ldots + (-5.5)^2} \]
\[ = 0 \]

Since both the numerator and denominator are zero, the Pearson correlation coefficient \( r \) would be undefined. This means that there's no linear correlation between the calories consumed and weight loss in this scenario.
