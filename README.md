# Introduction
Before the birth of my son I sought to lose some weight under the knowledge that weight management would be at the back of my mind during his first few months of life. I meticulously documented this 12 week 'shred' across MyFitnessPal and an Apple Numbers workbook, noting key values in relation to calorie intake and expenditure.

## Motivation
Now having this data I thought it an informative exercise to
1) Learn from my mistakes for future 'cuts' / 'shreds'
2) Find key measurements that interrupt the sustainability of the diet
3) Learn some Data Science along the way
4) Brush up on coding skills

# Methodology
This analysis covers a variety of analytical tools under the guise of Exploratory Data Analysis. In the vein of novel exploration, I opted to derive patterns and correlations from combinations of all data as opposed to seeking correlations between specific sets. Within the repo you will find the python file/s utilised for the data analysation preperations, as well as the resulting files which are analysed in the next chapter.

The resulting files I mention are under 5 data analysation methods each for 2 sets of data. My original data had a combination of daily and weekly values. This I opted to seperate to look distinctly at Daily and then Weekly. Within each of these I analysed:

1) Heatmap
2) Pair Plot
3) Scatter Plot
4) Histogram
5) Cat Plot
